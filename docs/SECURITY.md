# Security Guide

This document describes how secrets, TLS, and IAM are configured.

Secrets:
- All secrets are stored in AWS Secrets Manager. Use `./scripts/init-secrets.sh` to bootstrap placeholder secrets, then update values using `aws secretsmanager put-secret-value`.

TLS:
- Self-signed certificates are generated by `./nginx/generate-ssl.sh`. For production, replace with certificates from a CA and update `nginx/certs/`.

Authentication:
- Basic auth is enforced for Prometheus and Alertmanager via nginx `auth_basic` and an htpasswd file at `/etc/nginx/.htpasswd`.

IAM:
- EC2 instances use an instance profile created by the `iam` Terraform module. The role grants read access to Secrets Manager and Cost Explorer.
